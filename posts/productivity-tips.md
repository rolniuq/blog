# 5 Productivity Tips for Developers

Over the years, I've discovered several habits that significantly boost my productivity. Here are my top 5 tips.

## 1. Time Blocking

Dedicate specific time blocks for different activities:

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 9:00 - 11:00 | Deep work (coding) |
| 11:00 - 11:30 | Emails & messages |
| 11:30 - 12:30 | Meetings |
| 14:00 - 16:00 | Deep work (coding) |
| 16:00 - 17:00 | Code review & planning |

## 2. Use Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn the shortcuts for your tools:

- **VS Code**: `Cmd/Ctrl + P` for quick file open
- **Terminal**: `Ctrl + R` for reverse search
- **Browser**: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + T` to reopen closed tab

## 3. Automate Repetitive Tasks

Create scripts for common operations:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Quick project setup script

mkdir $1
cd $1
git init
npm init -y
echo "node_modules" > .gitignore
code .
```

## 4. Take Regular Breaks

The Pomodoro Technique works wonders:

- Work for 25 minutes
- Break for 5 minutes
- After 4 cycles, take a 15-30 minute break

## 5. Document As You Go

Write notes while working:

- What problem you're solving
- Solutions you tried
- What finally worked

This saves time when you encounter similar issues later.

## Bonus: Sleep Well!

Never underestimate the power of good sleep. A well-rested mind solves problems faster.
